    [Maria Carrasco](http://carrasco.in) helped me write this text
    editor to show-case [Immer](immer), my library of immutable
    data-structures.  It's code is extremely simple yet it performs
    better than most serious editors.  The *undo/redo* feature is just
    10 lines of code, yet it can copy-paste a gigabite worth of text
    with no problem!

    A library of persistent and immutable data structures in C++ that
    are fast, customizable and easy to embed in higher languages.  It
    implements modern cache-efficient data structures like
    [RRB-Trees](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/213452/files/rrbvector.pdf),
    with some improvements of its own---there is a paper about these
