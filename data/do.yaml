    A web app to choose a place to eat close to the Ableton office, in
    Berlin mitte.  I made this app on my last week of work, in march
    2016, as a farewell present for my colleagues that eat outside of

    This is an Ableton Live inspired web app to make music by playing
    multiple clips.  Tempo can be adjusted and everything is kept in
    sync.  The app was done mostly by [Maria

    I presented the work on [Atria](/do/atria) at
    [CppCon](http://cppcon.org/) in 2015.  The session describes the
    transducers module and its implementation, which is somewhat
    surprisingly, less stateful than the Clojure counterpart and very
    performant.
