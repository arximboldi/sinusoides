This is the code for [my personal webpage](http://sinusoid.es) â€” my
portfolio and playground for experimentation with web technologies. It
has survived several rewrites since it was first published in 2011.
It is currently built using [ClojureScript](http://clojurescript.net/)
and [Reagent](http://clojurescript.net/).

Development
-----------

### Compile

```
make
```

### Watchers

**TL;DR** run this and go to:
[localhost:8746/debug/](http://localhost:8746/debug/)

```
make dev
```

#### Long version

```
make figwheel
```

Now you have a server on http://localhost:3449 that autoupdates
whenever you touch a file.  When touching the Sass files, one should
do as well:

```
make watch-sass
```

Alternatively, it is possible to `npm install` and then run a local
server with:

```
make serve
```

This creates a server in [localhost:8746](http://localhost:8746) that
also serves the release version of the application.  The debug version
is available on [localhost:8746/debug/](http://localhost:8746/debug/)

### Deployment

```
make upload
```

Fill the password in `host.ncftpput` and remember to not commit it!
