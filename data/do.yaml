    In 2025 I helped [Olivia Nava Igual](https://www.olivia-ni.com/)
    design, implement and host her artist's portfolio, including a few
    easter eggs and a responsive design that works well on mobile,

    In 2024 I collaborated with Dusty Robotics, a company making
    robots that print building plans and layout on the floor of
    construction sites.  I rewrote their plan viewer in Rust and
    WebGL, achieving much better performance, and mentored their team
    in graphics programming, API design, and software optimization.

    team at Meta, that was exploring using
    [Immer](https://github.com/arximboldi/immer) to improve
    performance. As part of this collaboration, I added support for
    _transients_ for maps and sets in Immer, and mentored their team
    in best using immutable data-structures. The project was deployed
    at scale, this is critical infrastructure serving millions of
    machines. We lowered the average latency by an order of magnitude,
    and memory usage was halved.

    Zug is a C++ library providing

    are composable sequential transformations independent of the
    source. They are extremely lightweight, and can be used to express

    push based sequences (signals, events, asynchronous streams) in a
    generic way.

    In 2012 I talked about template metaprogramming at a *Ableton Dev
    Salon*, showing how C++ templates are lazy, purely functional,
    meta-language with a unityped type system of its own.  Some of the
    content is a bit dated, as
    [Boost Hana](https://github.com/boostorg/hana) have refined the
    techniques for C++14 and beyond.
